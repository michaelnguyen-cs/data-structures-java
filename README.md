# Data Structures in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms from my CS210 course.

The purpose of this repository is to practice core computer science concepts including data organization, algorithm design, and object-oriented programming.

Topics covered include:
- Stacks and Queues
- Linked Lists
- Searching Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms
- Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Each program focuses on correct implementation and problem-solving rather than user interface design.
